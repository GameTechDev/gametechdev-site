#### [Intel® Implicit SPMD Program Compiler](https://ispc.github.io/)

ispc is a compiler for a variant of the C programming language, with extensions for “single program, multiple data” (SPMD) programming. Under the SPMD model, the programmer writes a program that generally appears to be a regular serial program, though the execution model is actually that a number of program instances execute in parallel on the hardware.

#### [Intel® Graphics Performance Analyzers](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/graphics-performance-analyzers.html)

Intel® Graphics Performance Analyzers (Intel® GPA) is an application suite that contains tools for analysis and optimization of graphics-intensive applications, including but not limited to Microsoft DirectX, Vulkan, Metal, and OpenGL games. With Intel GPA, you can test your applications on various platforms to detect bottlenecks and find the best optimization for each platform. You can also enable/disable certain features (such as detailed terrain features or additional interactive game elements) until you achieve the optimal game-playing experience.
